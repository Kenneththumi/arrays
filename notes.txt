# Declaring an array

1.Assign a value to an element of an array that does not exist

			$my_array[2] = 2006;

2. Use the array construct 

$my_array=array(); # creates empty array

or

$my_array = array("Hello",2, TRUE);

Example

$prime[0] = 2;
$prime[1] = 3;
$prime[] = 5; # 5 s stored in index 2.

Note: even if the script had a scalar variable called $prime before the assignment $prime[0] = 1
$prime becomes an array
